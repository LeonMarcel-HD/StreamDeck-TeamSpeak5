== Setup

=== Connecting TeamSpeak
    
Launch TeamSpeak and head over to the **Settings** ->
**Remote Apps**. Make sure that the Port matches.

Now you should see a request sent by the Plugin, accept it.

=== Setting up Keybindings

After the connection is established, you need to bind each Stream Deck
Button to a TeamSpeak Keybinding.

(Similar to what you do with a regular Key. The Plugin just sends
virtual Keys)

So set up your Buttons on the Stream Deck, select the corresponding
function you want the Button mapped to.

For example, you place the Mute Action on your Stream Deck, then you need
to select **Choose** on the Mute Binding in TeamSpeak and
press the Button on the Stream Deck. You need to repeat this for every
other Key, as TeamSpeak currently does not offer a way to set up the
Bindings automatically!

=== Configuration of Whisperlists

Create a Whisperlist in TeamSpeak

Place your Button on the Stream Deck and input the name of the Whisperlist
(This name does not need to match, but could interfere with other
Whisperlist Buttons if two buttons are named the same)

Click on **Choose** to set the Keybinding, then press the
Button on the Stream Deck and select the Whisperlist on the left side
beside the Keybinding.
